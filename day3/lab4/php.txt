PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a server-side 
scripting language designed for Web development, but also used as a 
general-purpose programming language.
 It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994,[5] 
 the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.[6] PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,[5] but 
 it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[7] 
. Most notably, it introduces return type declarations for functions,[60] which complement the existing parameter type 
declarations, and support for the scalar types (integer, float, string, and boolean) in parameter and return type declarations
